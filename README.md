# The Book of the Runtime
The Book of the Runtime (BOTR) for the .NET Runtime. 

Combined articles from the official [CoreCLR repo](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/tree/master/Documentation/botr) about the non-trivial internals of the .NET Runtime.
It is available in EPUB and MOBI formats.

The ebook is created manually by combining the articles by using [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/). There may be some alignment issues, even though I fixed most of them.

This is the ebook conversion process now :sweat:
* Convert all markdown docs to pdf
* Merge all pdf and convert it to EPUB
* Edit book for toc page, cover, fix alignment issues etc
* Convert EPUB to MOBI format

Thanks to @giggio :thumbsup: for the automation idea.

I already tried few option (markdown to html, markdown to pdf) to automate the book by using scripts but it had some issues on alignments, images etc.
If anyone had a better idea feel free to send a PR :heart_eyes:

*Note: Book is updated and old version moved to old folder. Authors list is not updated.*
